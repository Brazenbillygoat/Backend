This is the backend for the DisStreamChat application, it contains the discord and twitch bots that allow integration between a discord `live chat` channel and twitch chat, this allow users without twitch accounts or who prefer discord to chat with the streamer without making the streamer look at two chats. This codebase also stores the code for all the other features of the discord and twitch bots.

DisStreamChat is currently in early alpha, but you can add it at [disstreamchat.com](https://www.disstreamchat.com/#/)
